            <p>I am new developer coming from the science world where I mostly
                used Matlab,  and did some editing of files in JS, VB, python 
                and sometimes managed networks. Working as a technician on 
                Oceanographic research ships was engaging work that allowed me
                to meet interesting people, travel to many places for work, and 
                to enjoy water sports. 
            </p>
            <p>I enjoy learning and trying new things. I am now looking for a new place to live
                and work. For the first time in a decade, it'll be away from the coast. I look forward
                to more hiking and paddling! </p>
